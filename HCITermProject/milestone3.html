  <b>Part A: </b>
<br>
After completing Milestone 2, our group came to the conclusion that our calendar merger should have a convenient, user-friendly implementation. We want our users to be able to merge calendars from various email services into one platform that has an appealing look and easy-to-follow interface. So, our calendar merger should have standard rows and columns in imitation of the monthly calendar with color coded reminders correlating to the email service from which the reminder came.
<br>
With these requirements, our 2 user stories are:
<ul>
<li>As a user, I want to sign in to each of my email accounts so that I can view all of my reminders in one place </li>
<li>As a user, I want be able to choose a color for each email service so that I am able to easily identify relevant reminders </li>
</ul>
These user stories are both important, but the most important one is definitely the latter. We wanted our implementation to focus on a user-friendly implementation. The color coded reminders allow users to easily identify which reminders are from which email. Hopefully, users will find this implementation as favorable and simple.
<br>
  <b>Part B:</b> 
<br>
Since the first user story talks about enabling users to add an email account to the calendar merger, the first wireframe includes a sign-in pop up box that prompts users to enter their credentials. Additionally, the second wireframe prompts users to enter their email and password  in the top right corner of the screen in order to add that email account’s calendar to the merger.
<br>
The second user story infers that users should be able to view events from both of their calendars and confirm whether there is a scheduling conflict, so the third wireframe shows a visual of two different events from two separate email accounts overlapping each other. This overlap signifies a scheduling conflict. The fourth wireframe uses a red block to signify that there is a scheduling conflict at that time block. Realistically, the user should be able to click on that red block and see the details of the scheduling conflict.
<br>
The last user story wants to be able to customize the color of the events that show up in the merger, according to that event’s respective email account, so the fifth wireframe provides the user with a settings pop-up box which allows users to select their color preferences. The sixth wireframe has the same settings pop-up box but it uses elements from the second wireframe that includes the sign-in fields in the top right corner.
