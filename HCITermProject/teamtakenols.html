<b>PART A:</b>
<br>
The foundation of our study revolves around the common issues that come with overwhelmingly busy lifestyles for people. Whether they are a working parent with two children playing their respective sports or a single employed person who also is involved in their respective club sports, people have multiple schedules they must tend to and stay on top of. Because remote working has recently become a universal aspect of the professional world, people must be able to maintain their same organized way of life. Take this as an example: a mother’s Outlook email dings during her lunch break while she is relaxing in bed… Johnny Appleseed has invited her to the scrum meeting for said project on Monday October 12, 2020 at 11am. She quickly accepts, assuming she is free…in fact, her outlook calendar says she is! And typically, Mondays are not too hectic…greater responsibilities and deadlines usually follow in the latter half of the week. Later that night as she plans her next day and scans all of her calendars, she eventually remembers the promise she made to her daughter… she promised to attend her award ceremony on that day…but that event exists on her google calendar. Now the mother is in a dilemma because she had already opted into attending her scrum meeting for work. In the mother’s case, it is easy to see that remote working can come with divided attention at times. We are all still getting used to this new way of life.
<br> 
The goal is for users to simply stay organized. When a user receives an invitation, they might not always resort to checking their other calendars immediately before accepting. This is usually initiated as an opportunistic plan because it occurs in the spur of the moment—once the user receives an invite. However, once the event is added to the calendar, it then becomes planned.
Before she accepted the invitation she probably should’ve thought through the process better: will I be available? Do I have any existing conflicts? But instead, she assumed she would be good since her daughter typically doesn’t have early morning events on a Monday. Therefore, she specifically accepted the invitation and added it to her outlook calendar…later realizing that she had a time conflict that existed on her google calendar. She is now stuck. She has to choose between attending a pivotal job meeting or being present at her daughter’s ceremony. She cannot physically do both.
<br> 
Perception wise, the mother is now stressed. She has put herself in a difficult position where she doesn’t want to let her boss or her child down. It’s possible she can fulfill her responsibility for the scrum meeting by giving her two cents right at the beginning while physically present at her daughter’s school…say in a quiet hallway, but that is a lot. Let’s compare it to what it could’ve been…she could have declined the invitation and proposed a new time for the scrum meeting if she knew she had a time conflict. She then would be able to give her undivided attention to both events.
<br> 
Nearly all working-class citizens with responsibilities and commitments other than what may fall within their work life are affected by our problem of study. Also, those that may not be the user themselves can be affected. The daughter will be positively affected if her mother attends the ceremony or negatively affected if she does not. Johnny Appleseed will be negatively affected if the mother is a crucial part of the scrum meeting and is not present…in the case that she is a scrum master or positively affected if she is present. And the mother herself, will be positively affected if she is able to stay on top of all of her events and responsibilities.
Whether or not a user utilizes our proposed solution, they would certainly benefit from a solution by staying more organized. Their work and personal lives will become cohesive and interconnected easily by adding all events to one common platform, or even if they’re just great remembering things off the top of their head (which is quite unrealistic)…they might not need to!

 <p style="font-family: 'Libre Franklin', sans-serif; font-size: 15px;">
I think these principles and guidelines will help serve our users because we want our product to be useful for all people regardless of the platform they choose. By ensuring ease-of-use in our product, customers will be more likely to find the product beneficial and necessary rather than a complex task. When looking for solutions to our problem, I found that many calendar platforms  have options to merge 2 or more calendars. The solution that I found to be the most popular tool is the Microsoft Outlook Calendar Merger. The directions for the merge tool are separated into two methods: a copy & paste method and an export-import method. Step-by-step instructions on how to execute each method are found on Microsoft’s website. While the instructions seem to be helpful, I found the instructions to be complex and long-winded. Each method includes at least 10 steps which require the user to be comfortable with Microsoft’s calendar technology. To someone with little experience in Outlook’s calendar, the merge tool could appear to be a daunting task. I was able to look up forums where people discussed having problems merging their Outlook calendars. So, it seems as though the step-by-step instructions are not as straightforward as they should be. In addition to the complex instructions, I also found that this calendar tool does not work across platforms. A user with a Google calendar and an Outlook calendar would not be able to merge the 2 into one. Lastly, I found that the tool does not take into consideration that some users with disabilities may not be able to read and understand the complex instructions needed to use the tool. My team plans to address these problems in our design. Due to these issues, I think that the Outlook calendar is lacking in the universal accessibility guideline. We believe that this guideline will help serve our users because we want our product to be useful for all people. By ensuring ease-of-use in our product and universal accessibility, customers will be more likely to find our product beneficial and necessary rather than a complex task.

<b>PART C:</b>
<br>
As stated earlier, there are already some calendar mergers in existence like Microsoft’s Outlook and Google’s Gmail but those calendar mergers are built by those companies and they only allow users to merge accounts from that same email service. Our proposed solution is a new interface that follows a standard rows and columns model of displaying a monthly calendar. This new interface is more convenient AND more flexible than the existing calendar mergers because it will allow users to merge at least two different calendars from email addresses from at least two different email services. Our proposed interface will prompt first-time users to sign-in to at least two email services with calendars that they would like to merge. This user sign-in would likely be implemented using a pop-up box and the affordances of this pop-up box would be text fields for users to enter an email and password and a sign-in button. The calendar table with rows and columns is an affordance because it serves the purpose of telling users when they have scheduled events and reminders. Once the user has signed in, the interface will inform the user of which accounts that they are currently signed into in one of the corners of the screen. The initially blank calendar that follows a rows for times and columns for days model will now be populated with entries of events and reminders which will be color-coded according to the email service that the entry came from. Thus, these color-coded calendar entries act as signifiers, as they signify which email service that they come from. 
<br><br> 
The criteria and standards that we will be using to measure if our calendar merger is a success is: 
   </p>
<ol style="font-family: 'Libre Franklin', sans-serif; font-size: 15px;">
<li>The user must be able to successfully sign-in to each of their email accounts </li>
<li>The calendar entries with their descriptions from each of the users email accounts must appear in their appropriate row and column </li>
<li>The colors of each calendar entry must correspond with their appropriate email service </li>
<li>Each calendar entry must follow a universal title, location, and description format </li>
<li>The user must not have to supply more effort other than signing-in, in order to make the merger more accessible and less complex </li>
</ol>
